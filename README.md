# Kaushal-Kandhari-Final-Project-Assignment-4.3-Gym-Membership-Angular-Front-end-with-Mongo-DB-backend.
The first step is to install all the packages required like express, bodyparser, cors and mongoose packers. A restful API is created and then connected to the new backend database file named "HardrockGYM". This Mongo DB consists of gym memberships of the clients, age, weightloss calories, gym experience, calorie target, Heavy Intensity Training (HIT) requirement, and work out targets.
Once the mongo database is created, it acts as the backend. 
A server is created and makes a connection with the backend HarrockGYM database.
Now for the front end, we use Angular to connect with the server and then access the database. 
In the Anguar server file, we establish the link to the server and then the database. 
Finally, we call the database by using Angular by sending a HTTP request through the api named "HardrockGYMapi". The HTTP request calls the database through this api and access the gym clients membership details.
